Independent_Study_to_run_supervised_machine_learning_on_fashion_mnist_data


This independent study(IS) aims to learn supervised machine learning using scikit-learn and comparing the accuracy score of the results with the results of running a model by DataRobot, an auto machine learning(AutoML) tool. For the dataset, Fashion MNIST and MNIST datasets are used. 

This IS starts with learning supervised machine learning by using Scikit-learn as a machine learning tool.
